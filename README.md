# Predictive-Modeling-for-Sourcing-Costs

Welcome to the Predictive Modeling for Sourcing Costs GitHub repository! This project focuses on leveraging predictive analytics techniques to estimate sourcing costs effectively.

## Summary
This repository contains code and resources for predictive modeling of sourcing costs using different approaches. The project aims to provide insights into cost estimation, optimize model performance, and facilitate data-driven decision-making in sourcing management.

## Data Preparation
•⁠  ⁠*Train and Test Sets:* The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the models and evaluate their performance, respectively.
•⁠  ⁠*Feature Engineering:* Prior to modeling, thorough preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance data quality and extract relevant features.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Different evaluation approaches have been employed to assess the effectiveness of cost prediction models, involving both model training and evaluation stages. These methods encompass various metrics tailored to the specific characteristics of each model, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of performance across different contexts and algorithms.

## Forecasting on Test Set
The forecasting model is applied to the test set to generate predictions for future sourcing costs. The accuracy of the forecasts is assessed using relevant evaluation metrics.

## Auto-Logging Library
To streamline model development and experimentation, this project utilizes the Auto-Logging library. The details on the Auto-Logging library can be found on its [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/AutoLogging-ML/).
